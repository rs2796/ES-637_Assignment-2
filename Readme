Important points:
There are two matlab files for this assignment.
They are:
1. main.m
2. RotationTranslation.m

The RotationTranslation.m is a function which computes the rotation matrix (R) and translation vector (t).

One has to run the main.m file for getting the output.
This file will load the input images from the RGBD_dataset which is in the assignment-2 folder only.
